# KVM

A KVM to help control a lot of servers without the need for multiple monitors and peripherals.

At present, we have 4 connectors for a total of 4 clients. These are likely quite inexpensive, however they must use VGA to work with the KVM. Theoretically, we would use an HDMI to VGA if we wanted to use this on a machine like [Totoro](/systems/totoro), however the system needs to be tested first.
